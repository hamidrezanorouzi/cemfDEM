* About cemfDEM
 cemfDem code is a free, open source code for discrete element method (DEM)
 simulaitons. It is developed in FORTRAN standard and can simulate spherical
 particles. The code benefits from various optimization algorithms giving rise
 to its execution speed. Therefore, simulating tens of thousand particles
 within a reasonable time is possible. This code can be compiled and run under
 both Windows- and Ubuntu-based operating systems.
 
  - *Particles*: Particles with single size, or size distribution, or various density, or physical properties can be simulated.
  - *Geometry*: The geometry of parts (container, blades and etc.) can be as simple as a cylindrical drum or as complex as a helical blade. A combination of linear and rotational motion can be specified for parts (blades). STL files can be imported into the program to define geometry parts. 
  - *Integration*: Various integration methods from single-step to multi-step methods and with various numerical precision from the first order to fifths order are implemented in the code.
  - *Contact force models*: Both linear and non-linear contact force with non-limited and limited tangential displacement models are available in the code as well as rolling friction models.
  - *Contact search*: Efficient contact search methods suitable for systems single size and systems with wide size distribution are implemented in the code to be used. So, the simulations with multi-sized particles run as efficiently as the simulation with single size particles.
